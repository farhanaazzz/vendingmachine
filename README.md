# vendingmachine

This is a small C++ project I did during my first year programming subject. I used the Dev-C++ IDE. It is a food vending machine system where the price of each item is randomly generated.
User has the option to display the price in other currencies such as Bangladesh Taka and Japanese Yen. The system also generates random four-digit number as the user's secret code.
